Dynamic

  If set, cells of this type will never be put into a static vertex buffer
  and instead updated every frame. Implied by UVTurb, Wave and Liquid.

Liquid

  Makes cells of this type behave like a liquid and flow from cell to cell.

NoRender

  Do not render cells of this type at all.

Transparent

  be hidden.

DoubleSided

  Draw the inside faces of cells of this type too.

Pickable

  Consider cells of this type to be usable by mobs. (Pickable in the sense
  of "can be picked by ray cast")

OnUseReplace

  When successfully used, replace cells of this type with ones of the type
  specified in the "Replace" property. See Replace.

Multi

  The texture of cells of this type must contain 8 subtextures of which 6
  are used for the faces of the cell. From left to right these must be
  the textures for the left, right, front, back, top and bottom faces.

Ladder

  Mobs inside cells of this type may float up or down freely.

Tex                 TextureName

  Add possible texture for this cell. One will be chosen at random.

EmissiveTex         TextureName

  Add possible emissive texture for this cell. The same index is used as for
  the normal texture. If there is no emissive texture for that index, no
  emissive texture will be used.

ActiveTex           TextureName

  Same as Tex but for when the cell is in an activated state.

EmissiveActiveTex   TextureName

  Same as EmissiveTex but for when the cell is in an activated state.

Light               R G B

  Light emission from this cell type. R, G and B are integers with full
  brightness at 255. Values can exceed full brightness and are not clamped.

LightScale          Factor

  Scaling factor for the light parameter.

LightFactor         Factor

  Factor by which light passing through from other cells is multiplied.

LightFade           Value

  Integer that is subtracted from each RGB component of light entering the
  cell. Values will be clamped to 0 if the would go negative.

Speed               Factor

  Speed modifier for mobs moving in the cell.

Friction            Factor

  Friction modifier for mobs walking on top of the cell.

ShowSides           SideMask

  A combination of sides that are to always be drawn. Can be a string
  containing the characters lrudfb. Any other characters will be ignored.
  Sides are encoded as follows:

    l: Left
    r: Right
    u: Up       (top)
    d: Down     (bottom)
    f: Forward  (front)
    b: Backward (back)

HideSides           SideMask

  A combination of sides that are to always be hidden. Overrides ShowSides.

ClipSidesIn         SideMask

  A combination of sides that are to stop mob movement when moving into the
  cell. Default for solid cells is lrudfb (all sides).

ClipSidesOut        SideMask

  A combination of sides that are to stop mob movement when moving out of the
  cell. Default for solid cells is lrudfb (all sides).

OnUseCascade        SideMask

  A combination of sides that are to be informed about a mob using the cell.
  This can be used to implement multi cell dungeon features like doors.

UseDelay            Interval

  Time that has to pass after the cell has been used before it can be used
  again.

UseChance           Probability

  Probabilty that a use actually succeeds. Can be used to implement jammed
  doors and secret passages.

Replace             CellType

  Sets the target cell replacement type. See also OnUseReplace and
  DetailBelowReplace.

Strength            BreakStrength

  Sets the resistance against breaking cells of this type with a tool or
  in an explosion. The propability of a cell of this type to break is
  calculated as BreakBlockStrength of the tool / BreakStrength. A negative
  value will prevent breakage. Default is -1.

LavaDamage          DamagePerSecond

  Entities inside cells of this type will get this much lava damage per
  second.

Scale               X Y Z

  Scale the cells of this type by this vector. This is only for rendering.

BreakParticle       EntityType

  Type of entity to spawn when cells of this type are broken.

DetailBelowReplace  Amount

  When the cells of this type are a liquid and the liquid amount goes below
  this, they will be replaced by cells of the type specified in the Replace
  property.

ReplaceChance       Factor

  Only apply DetailBelowReplace with a probability of this per cell tick.

FlowOntoReplaceTarget   From To Own

  I have no idea.

LockedChance        Probability

  Probability that cells of this type will be locked on level start. If
  locked, a key will be generated and put somewhere else in the level.
